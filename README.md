Here’s a clear, well-structured project description you can use for your GitHub repository about CRUD Books in Node.js.

**📚 CRUD Books API – Node.js**
**📌 Overview**

This is a simple Books CRUD API built using Node.js and the native http module.
It demonstrates how to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on a collection of books stored in memory (or from a JSON file).
The API is designed to handle different HTTP methods and uses UUID validation to ensure that each book ID is unique and correctly formatted.

**✨ Features**

GET /api/books → Fetch all books 📖

GET /api/books/:id → Fetch a single book by ID 🔍

POST /api/books → Add a new book ➕

PUT /api/books/:id → Update book details ✏️

DELETE /api/books/:id → Remove a book ❌

UUIDv4 Validation for book IDs 🔑

JSON-based responses for easy API testing

**🛠 Technologies Used**

Node.js (Native http module)

JavaScript 

UUID Regular Expressions

JSON for data storage

**📋 Example Book Object**
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "The Great Gatsby",
  "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
  "year": 1925
}

**🚀 How to Run:**
**1. Install dependencies:**
   npm install
   nodemon install
   dotenv install
**2. Start the server:**
   node server.js
**3. Test API using Postman or cURL.**

**📌 Example API Requests**
1. Using GET you can fetch all books.
2. curl http://localhost:5001/api/books
3. If ytou using the VScode thun install the extension thundering then you can easily see all the books using tbe above url and you can easily use GET,POST,PUT,DELETE.

**INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:**
**📌 Node.js & Express API Interview Questions and Answers**
**1. What is REST?**

**Answer:**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP to perform CRUD operations on resources, which are identified by URIs. REST APIs are stateless and rely on standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

**2. What are HTTP methods and their use?**

**Answer:**
The main HTTP methods used in REST APIs:

GET → Retrieve data from the server

POST → Send new data to the server

PUT → Update existing data (replace)

PATCH → Update part of the data

DELETE → Remove data from the server

OPTIONS → Describe allowed communication options

**3. How do you handle routes in Express?**

**Answer:**
In Express, routes define how the server responds to requests:
app.get('/api/books', (req, res) => { ... });
app.post('/api/books', (req, res) => { ... });
app.put('/api/books/:id', (req, res) => { ... });
app.delete('/api/books/:id', (req, res) => { ... });
You can also use the Router object to organize routes in separate files.

**4. What is middleware in Express?**

**Answer:**
Middleware are functions that execute during the request-response cycle.
They can:

Modify req or res objects

Execute code

Call the next middleware
Example:
app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON request body

**5. How do you parse JSON in Express?**

**Answer:**
Use the built-in express.json() middleware:
app.use(express.json());
It automatically parses incoming JSON requests and makes the data available in req.body.

**6. What status codes do you use for CRUD?**

**Answer:**
Common HTTP status codes:

200 OK → Successful GET/PUT/DELETE

201 Created → Successful POST (new resource)

204 No Content → Successful request, no data returned

400 Bad Request → Invalid input

404 Not Found → Resource not found

500 Internal Server Error → Server-side error

**7. How would you handle errors in Express?**

**Answer:**
Use error-handling middleware:
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).json({ message: 'Something went wrong!' });
});
You can also send specific status codes depending on the type of error.

**8. What is CORS?**

**Answer:**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain.
To enable CORS in Express:
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());

**9. Explain request and response objects in Express.**

**Answer:**

Request (req) → Represents the HTTP request; contains details like req.params, req.query, req.body, req.headers.

Response (res) → Represents the HTTP response; used to send data back with methods like res.send(), res.json(), res.status().

**10. How do you test API endpoints?**

**Answer:**
You can test API endpoints using:

Postman – Send requests and check responses

cURL – Command-line HTTP client

Automated testing – Using libraries like Jest + Supertest in Node.js

Example with cURL:
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/books
